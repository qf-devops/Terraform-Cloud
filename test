========================================================================

You did it! You just provisioned infrastructure with Terraform Cloud!

The organization we created here has a 30-day free trial of the Team &
Governance tier features. After the trial ends, you'll be moved to the Free tier.

You now have:

  * Workspaces for organizing your infrastructure. Terraform Cloud manages
    infrastructure collections with workspaces instead of directories. You
    can view your workspace here:
    https://app.terraform.io/app/example-org-e5e708/workspaces/getting-started
  * Remote state management, with the ability to share outputs across
    workspaces. We've set up state management for you in your current
    workspace, and you can reference state from other workspaces using
    the 'terraform_remote_state' data source.
  * Much more!
